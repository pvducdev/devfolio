# About Me

Welcome to my portfolio! This is an example MDX file that demonstrates the power of combining **Markdown** with **React components**.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can write markdown like normal, and also import and use React components.

## Features

- GitHub Flavored Markdown support
- Automatic heading IDs with `rehype-slug`
- Auto-linked headings with `rehype-autolink-headings`
- Full React component integration
- Fast build-time compilation with Vite

## Code Example

```typescript
const greeting = (name: string) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greeting("World"));
```

## List Example

1. First item
2. Second item
   - Nested item
   - Another nested item
3. Third item

This content is loaded dynamically using Vite's MDX plugin and displayed in the tab system!
